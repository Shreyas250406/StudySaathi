## 📖 About the Project

NGO classrooms often face the challenge of "mixed-ability" groups where a single teacher manages students at different learning levels. 

**StudySaathi** solves this by:
* **Personalizing Difficulty:** Using AI logic to serve questions that match a student's current "Learning Score."
* **Empowering Teachers:** Providing a bird's-eye view of the classroom to identify which students are excelling and who needs immediate intervention.
* **Accessibility:** Offering courses segmented by grade and language to cater to diverse backgrounds.

💡 The Problem & Solution
The Problem: Traditional classroom teaching follows a "one-size-fits-all" approach. In NGOs, where educational backgrounds vary wildly, students at the top get bored, and students at the bottom get lost.

The Solution: StudySaathi implements an Adaptive Learning Logic. As a student answers correctly, the system increases the complexity of concepts. If they struggle, it provides foundational questions. This ensures the "Zone of Proximal Development" is maintained for every learner, maximizing educational outcomes.
